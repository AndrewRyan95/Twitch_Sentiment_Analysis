    "This is an updated form that takes the place of the original NLSS notebook. However, it uses the more complete CSV files instead of the three smaller CSVs used in the original. In this Notebook, I organize data from a text document of dockets. The dockets include the date of the stream, who was on the show, and what games were played. I split up the data into categories and make lists out of the participants and games. I also take data on stream statistics from a CSV file. The data from the dockets and the stream stats are put together into one dataframe."
