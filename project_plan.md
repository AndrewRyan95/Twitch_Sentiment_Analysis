# Project Plan #
My goal is to analyize comments from the videos with [VADER Sentiment Analysis](https://github.com/cjhutto/vaderSentiment). Episodes will be assigned a positivity score determined by the ratio of comments in the episode which are either overwhelmingly positive or negative. Using features from docket information and stream statistics, a machine learning program will be built to predict a the percent of positive comments in the episode.
