# Justification for sharing data
My project has data gathered from various sources. 

I began my project with the NLSS Dockets found from http://twoandahalfscums.blogspot.co.uk/p/nlss.html. I contacted the owner of the site and was provided permission to use the data in this project. 

I gathered the stream statistics CSVs from the website [Sullygnome](sullygnome.com). I contacted the owner of the site and recieved permission to use the data as well as a CSV that covered a larger time span.

The comments are downloaded from Twitch using a Python script. From reading the Twitch Terms of Service, it looks like while Twitch declares the right to use User Content, that it is not claim ownership of the comments. As the comments are submitted to an open forum and can be viewed publicly by anyone who wishes to view the video, I am including them in this project. The comments for videos are stored in JSON files.
