# NLSS Analysis

Project by Andrew Ryan

A Data Science Project on the [Northernlion Live Super Show](http://whenisnlss.com/)

[Twitch](https://twitch.tv/) is a website where people livestream video games. A live feed of chat accompanies the video where people can talk to the streamer and viewers in real time. This project looks at a corpus of 5,000,000 million comments posted over 200 videos from a long running Twitch stream, the Northernlion Live Super Show. It looks at the relationship between the sentiment of chat's comments with statistics such as viewership, cast members, and games played.
