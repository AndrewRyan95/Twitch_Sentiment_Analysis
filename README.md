# Sentiment Analysis of Twitch Comments from the NLSS

[Andrew Ryan](https://andrewryan95.github.io/) | AndrewRyan@pitt.edu | December 2017


>[Twitch](https://twitch.tv/) is a website where people livestream video games. A live feed of chat accompanies the video where people can talk to the streamer and viewers in real time. This project looks at a self-made corpus of 5,000,000 million comments collected from over 200 videos of a long running Twitch stream, the [Northernlion Live Super Show](http://whenisnlss.com/). It looks at the relationship between the sentiment of the chat's comments with information such as [viewership statistics](https://sullygnome.com/channel/Northernlion), and the [show docket](http://twoandahalfscums.blogspot.co.uk/p/nlss.html).
